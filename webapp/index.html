                <p>Autism has historically been underdiagnosed in women and girls because the diagnostic criteria for autism have been based on research and clinical experience primarily with male subjects.<br><br>The symptoms of autism in women and girls can often present differently than in males. Females with autism may exhibit more subtle or less obvious social and communication difficulties, and may also develop coping mechanisms that mask some of their symptoms. As a result, they may not fit the stereotypical image of autism that is often portrayed in the media and popular culture.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="aboutUsRow2">
                <p>There is also a growing awareness among healthcare professionals that autism is not just a male condition, and efforts are being made to improve the diagnosis and treatment of autism in females. However, more research is needed to fully understand the unique presentation of autism in women and girls and to develop better screening tools and diagnostic criteria that take these differences into account.<br><br>At Speks, we want to bring awareness to this issue while also providing a platform for education and support.</p>
